# Liar's Poker – Bid Helper (Collective Hold’em Variant)

This web-based simulation tool helps players of the **Liar’s Poker Collective Hold’em Variant** evaluate the plausibility of specific 5-card poker hand bids.

## What It Does

- You input:
  - Your hand (e.g., `4 of Hearts`, `10 of Spades`)
  - The total number of cards in play (e.g., 20)
  - The most recent bid (e.g., `Three of a Kind, Queens`)
  - A confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5)
- The app simulates thousands of possible pools and tells you:
  - Whether the bid is likely valid
  - What stronger hands are probable
  - What your best next move might be

## Game Rules & Hand Rankings

This project uses the “Collective Hold’em” ruleset of Liar’s Poker.

- [Game Handbook and Bid Progressions (PDF)](Liar's%20Poker%20Handbook%20and%20Bid%20Progressions.pdf)
- [Bid Interpretation Guide (PDF)](Liar's%20Poker%20–%20Bid%20Interpretation%20Guide.pdf)

Key bidding clarifications:
- Bids must be fulfilled exactly — stronger hands don’t count
- For example, a **Full House** doesn’t satisfy a **Three of a Kind** bid
- Flushes are defined by high card, not suit hierarchy
- Royal Flush is treated as its own rank above Straight Flush

This project was built to test probability assumptions in advanced bluff-based gameplay — but can be extended into teaching tools, AI bidding bots, or player analytics.
